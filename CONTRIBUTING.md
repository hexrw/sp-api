# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing!

## How to contribute

1. **Fork & branch**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-topic
```

2. Write or update Markdown files in docs/.
3. Keep it legal & safe
    - No sensitive data, credentials, or private info.
    - Do not post internal Amazon docs, NDA-protected info, or credentials.
4. Submit a Pull Request
    - Use clear titles → “Add notes on GET_FBA_MYI_UNSUPPRESSED_INVENTORY_DATA”.
    - Link to any external sources you reference.

### Commit messages

Use conventional commit messages for clarity. Examples:
- `docs: add new guide for Foo`
- `fix: correct typo in API example`

We use [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to enforce this. If your commit message doesn't follow the format, it will fail the CI check.

## Questions or discussions?

Open a GitHub Issue for suggestions, clarifications, or new topics.
