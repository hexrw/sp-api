# CI/CD Setup - Change Summary

This document summarizes all changes made to establish the new CI/CD pipeline.

## Files Modified

### 1. `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` ✏️ MODIFIED
**Changes:**
- Added path filters to skip docs and markdown files
- Changed condition to skip release-please PRs (via label check) instead of bot user check
- This allows proper CI on all PRs except release PRs, which get tested during publish

**Rationale:** Release PRs don't need pre-merge CI since they'll be fully tested during the publish workflow.

---

### 2. `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yaml` ✏️ MODIFIED
**Changes:**
- Added path filters to only trigger on `docs/**` changes
- Only deploys when documentation actually changes

**Rationale:** Avoids unnecessary builds and GitHub Pages deployments for code changes.

---

### 3. `.github/workflows/publish-models.yaml` ✏️ MODIFIED
**Changes:**
- Removed `workflow_dispatch` trigger (simpler, use GitHub releases)
- Simplified tag checking (only `@selling-partner-api/models@*`)
- Removed redundant version checking logic
- Streamlined environment variable usage
- Removed unnecessary docs workspace check

**Rationale:** Cleaner, more maintainable, follows release-please conventions strictly.

---

### 4. `.github/workflows/publish-sdk.yaml` ✏️ MODIFIED
**Changes:**
- Removed `workflow_dispatch` trigger
- Simplified tag checking (only `@selling-partner-api/sdk@*`)
- Fixed models dependency wait logic (simpler, more robust)
- Validates exact version from package.json dependencies
- Builds both packages (not just SDK) to ensure compatibility
- Removed redundant version parsing logic

**Rationale:** More robust dependency checking, ensures models is available before publishing.

---

### 5. `.github/workflows/sync-models.yaml` ✏️ MODIFIED
**Changes:**
- Now creates a PR instead of pushing directly to main
- Removed git config setup (not needed with create-pull-request action)
- Removed manual release-please trigger
- Added `pull-requests: write` permission

**Rationale:** Prevents conflicts with release PRs by going through standard PR flow.

---

### 6. `.github/workflows/update-sdk-models-dependency.yaml` ✨ NEW
**Purpose:** Automatically update SDK's models dependency when models releases

**Triggers:**
- When a models package release is published

**Actions:**
1. Extracts version from release tag
2. Updates SDK's dependency using `bun add`
3. Creates a PR with the change

**Rationale:** Ensures SDK stays in sync with models, prevents manual dependency updates.

## Files Unchanged

### ✓ `.github/workflows/release-please.yaml`
Already correctly configured with:
- Separate PRs for each package
- Proper component naming
- Correct paths trigger

### ✓ `.github/workflows/release-please-auto-merge.yaml`
Working as intended:
- Auto-merges release PRs
- Proper label checking

### ✓ `.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yaml`
Working as intended:
- Auto-merges security and patch updates from Dependabot

### ✓ `release-please-config.json`
Already correctly configured:
- Separate pull requests enabled
- Component-specific tags
- Proper changelog paths

---

## New Documentation

Comprehensive documentation covering:
- All workflow purposes and triggers
- Release flow diagrams
- Conflict prevention strategies
- Testing strategies
- Conventional commit usage
- Secrets configuration
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting guide

### `.github/WORKFLOWS-QUICK-REF.md` ✨ NEW
Quick reference guide with:
- Visual trigger maps
- Release flow diagrams
- When workflows run table
- Key features summary
- Common commands
- Monitoring guidelines
- Emergency procedures

---

## Architecture Improvements

### Before ❌
1. CI ran on all PRs including release PRs (redundant)
2. Docs deployed on every main push (wasteful)
3. sync-models pushed directly to main (could conflict with releases)
4. No automatic SDK dependency updates after models release
5. Complex tag parsing logic in publish workflows
6. No comprehensive documentation

### After ✅
1. CI skips release PRs (tested during publish instead)
2. Docs deploy only when docs change
3. sync-models creates PRs (proper review flow)
4. Automatic SDK dependency update PRs after models releases
5. Simple, robust tag checking
6. Complete documentation with diagrams

## Testing Recommendations

### Before First Release
1. ✅ Make a test change to models package with conventional commit
2. ✅ Verify release-please creates a PR
3. ✅ Merge the PR and verify GitHub release is created
4. ✅ Verify publish-models workflow runs successfully
5. ✅ Verify update-sdk-models-dependency creates a PR
6. ✅ Test the full cycle with SDK package

### Ongoing Monitoring
- Watch for failed workflow runs in Actions tab
- Review release PRs before auto-merge triggers
- Monitor npm registry for published versions
- Check dependency update PRs are created after models releases

---

## Breaking Changes

### None! 🎉
All changes are backward compatible:
- Existing release-please configuration unchanged
- Package.json files unchanged
- Git workflow unchanged (still use conventional commits)
- Publishing targets unchanged (npm + GitHub Packages)

### What Developers Notice
- Release PRs may auto-merge faster (if auto-merge enabled)
- SDK dependency updates arrive as PRs (not manual)
- Sync-models creates PRs (not direct pushes)
- Fewer unnecessary CI runs

---

## Next Steps

1. **Configure NPM_SECRET** if not already set
   - GitHub Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add `NPM_SECRET` with npm authentication token

2. **Test the full release cycle** (recommended in a test branch first)
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test/release-flow
   # Make a small change to models
   git commit -m "feat: test release automation"
   git push
   # Watch the workflows in Actions tab
   ```

3. **Monitor first real release** closely
   - Verify all workflows complete successfully
   - Check packages appear on npm
   - Verify dependency update PR is created

4. **Update team documentation** if needed
   - Link to .github/WORKFLOWS.md in main README
   - Update CONTRIBUTING.md to mention conventional commits

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can:

1. **Disable auto-merge**: Remove `.github/workflows/release-please-auto-merge.yaml`
2. **Pause automation**: Disable workflows in GitHub Settings → Actions
3. **Manual publishing**: Use `npm publish` directly if publish workflows fail
4. **Revert workflows**: All original workflows are in git history

The system is designed to be safe - if automation fails, you can always publish manually.
