## Architecture Changes

### Before (Broken)
```
SDK (workspace) ‚Üí Models (workspace)
          ‚Üì
     Published SDK@0.3.1
          ‚Üì
     Depends on models@0.2.0 ‚ùå (doesn't exist!)
```

### After (Fixed)
```
Models ‚Üí npm @0.4.0 ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
SDK depends on ^0.4.0 from npm ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
SDK@1.0.0 ‚Üí npm ‚úÖ
```

## Still TODO (Next Steps)

### Phase 1: Complete SDK v1.0.0 Release
1. **Merge PR #30** (SDK v1.0.0 release)
2. **Publish SDK@1.0.0** (will trigger automatically or manually)
3. **Verify installation**: `npm install @selling-partner-api/sdk`

### Phase 2: Vendor Sync Automation
Create `.github/workflows/vendor-sync.yaml`:
- **Trigger**: Daily cron or manual
- **Action**: Check vendor submodule for changes
- **If changed**: Rebuild models, create PR, auto-merge if tests pass
- **Result**: Models automatically stays in sync with Amazon's updates

### Phase 3: SDK Auto-Update Workflow
Create `.github/workflows/update-sdk-models.yaml`:
- **Trigger**: When models publishes
- **Action**: Detect breaking changes, update SDK dependency
- **Create PR**: With appropriate commit message (breaking or not)
- **Auto-merge**: If tests pass
- **Result**: SDK automatically updates when models changes

### Phase 4: Breaking Change Detection
Create `.github/scripts/detect-breaking-changes.ts`:
- Compare old vs new models `paths.ts`
- Detect if any paths/operations removed
- Return breaking: true/false
- Use in SDK update workflow

### Phase 5: Testing & Refinement
- Test full cycle end-to-end
- Enable PR auto-merge for release PRs
- Monitor first automated releases
- Fine-tune automation based on results

---

## Commands to Complete

### Immediately: Merge and Publish SDK v1.0.0
```bash
# Merge the SDK release PR
gh pr merge 30 --squash

# Wait for release to be created
sleep 10

# Check release was created
gh release list --limit 3

# Manually trigger publish (if needed)
gh workflow run publish-sdk.yaml --field tag=sdk-v1.0.0

# Verify it's published
npm view @selling-partner-api/sdk@1.0.0
```

### Test Installation
```bash
# Create a test directory
mkdir /tmp/test-sdk && cd /tmp/test-sdk
npm init -y

# Install the SDK
npm install @selling-partner-api/sdk

# Should install successfully with models@0.4.0!
```

---

## Automation Workflows Needed

### 1. vendor-sync.yaml (New)
Monitors vendor submodule, rebuilds models when changes detected.

```yaml
name: vendor-sync
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  sync:
    - Check vendor submodule for changes
    - If changed:
      - cd packages/models
      - bun run build
      - Create PR with changes
      - Enable auto-merge if tests pass
```

### 2. update-sdk-models.yaml (New)
Updates SDK when models publishes, with breaking change detection.

```yaml
name: update-sdk-models
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["publish-models"]
    types: [completed]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      models_version:
        required: true

jobs:
  update:
    - Get latest models version
    - Run breaking change detection
    - Update package.json dependency
    - Create PR:
      - If breaking: "feat!: update models to vX.Y.Z"
      - If not: "fix: update models to vX.Y.Z"
    - Run tests
    - Enable auto-merge if tests pass
```

### 3. detect-breaking-changes.ts (New Script)
```typescript
// Compare old vs new models
// Check for removed paths/operations
// Return { breaking: boolean, removedPaths: string[] }
```

## File Changes Made

### Modified
- `packages/sdk/package.json` - Removed workspace:*, added ^0.4.0
- `packages/models/package.json` - Bumped to 0.4.0
- `.release-please-manifest.json` - Updated versions
- `.github/workflows/publish-sdk.yaml` - Added manual trigger, removed coverage
- `.github/workflows/publish-models.yaml` - Added manual trigger

### Created
- `.github/PUBLISH-SUCCESS.md`
- `.github/TESTING-FINAL-RESULTS.md`
- `.github/DECOUPLING-PLAN.md`
- `.github/STATUS-SUMMARY.md` (this file)

### To Delete
- `packages/sdk/scripts/sync-models-dependency.ts` - No longer needed

### To Create
- `.github/workflows/vendor-sync.yaml`
- `.github/workflows/update-sdk-models.yaml`
- `.github/scripts/detect-breaking-changes.ts`

---

## Success Metrics

### ‚úÖ Already Achieved
- Models package published and installable
- SDK fully decoupled from workspace
- Both packages have independent release processes
- Manual triggers available for testing
- Comprehensive documentation

### üéØ Next Milestones
- SDK v1.0.0 published and installable
- Vendor sync automation working
- SDK auto-updates when models changes
- Breaking change detection functional
- Zero manual intervention needed

---

## Risk Assessment

### Fixed Risks
- ~~SDK broken due to missing models dependency~~ ‚úÖ Fixed
- ~~Workspace coupling preventing independent releases~~ ‚úÖ Fixed
- ~~Missing models package on npm~~ ‚úÖ Fixed

### Remaining Risks
- **Vendor sync could create noise**: Only trigger on actual changes
- **Breaking change detection could fail**: Default to minor, require manual review
- **Auto-merge could merge broken code**: Comprehensive CI tests required

---

## Next Immediate Action

**MERGE PR #30** to publish SDK@1.0.0 and fix the broken installation!

```bash
gh pr merge 30 --squash
```

This will:
1. Trigger release-please to create release
2. Trigger publish-sdk workflow
3. Publish working SDK to npm
4. Users can finally install the SDK successfully!
