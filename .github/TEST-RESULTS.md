# CI/CD Testing Results & Fixes Needed

## Test Summary

We tested the new CI/CD pipeline and discovered several issues that need attention:

## Issues Found

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Workspace Dependencies
**Problem:** SDK package depends on `@selling-partner-api/models` which isn't published to npm yet.
- During development, `bun install` fails because it tries to fetch from npm
- Need to use `workspace:*` for local development

**Solution Implemented:**
- Changed SDK dependency to `workspace:*` in `package.json`
- Updated `sync-models-dependency.ts` script to convert `workspace:*` to `^X.Y.Z` during build
- Bun will convert workspace dependencies to actual versions when publishing

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### 2. ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION: Release-Please Permissions
**Problem:** Release-please workflow fails with "Resource not accessible by integration" when trying to create GitHub releases.

**Error Message:**
```
release-please failed: Resource not accessible by integration
https://docs.github.com/rest/releases/releases#create-a-release
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. Repository settings may restrict Actions permissions
2. Workflow might need additional permissions
3. Pre-existing release PRs might be conflicting

**Current Workflow Permissions:**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  id-token: write  # Added but may not be needed
```

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Check repository Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions
   - Should be set to "Read and write permissions"
2. Verify release-please action has correct permissions
3. Check if there are existing stale release PRs that need cleanup

**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS INVESTIGATION

---

### 3. ⚠️ EXISTS: Pre-existing Release PRs
**Found:** PR #24 "chore: release sdk@0.2.0" already exists
- Created by previous workflow attempts
- May be causing conflicts with new release-please runs

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Close existing release PRs (##24, #25 if exists)
2. Delete any orphaned release branches
3. Let release-please create fresh PRs

**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS CLEANUP

---

### 4. ℹ️ INFO: Old Tag Format
**Found:** Repository has old tags that don't match new format:
- Old format: `models-v0.2.0`, `sdk-v2.4.0-beta.0`, `v0.4.0`
- New format: `@selling-partner-api/models@0.2.0`, `@selling-partner-api/sdk@0.2.0`

**Impact:** Minimal - old tags won't trigger new workflows

**Recommended Actions:**
- Keep old tags for history
- New releases will use correct format

**Status:** ℹ️ INFORMATIONAL

## Current Test Status

### What's Working ✅
1. Workspace dependency setup
2. Build process (models and SDK)
3. Test execution
4. Sync-models-dependency script
5. Workflow file syntax (no YAML errors)

### What's Not Working ❌
1. Release-please creating releases (permissions issue)
2. CI workflow (failing due to coverage badge commit permission)

### Not Yet Tested ⏳
1. Full release cycle (blocked by permissions)
2. Automatic SDK dependency update after models release
3. Publishing to npm and GitHub Packages
4. Docs deployment
5. Auto-merge functionality

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required to proceed)

1. **Fix Repository Permissions**
   ```
   Repository Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions
   - Set to "Read and write permissions"
   - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
   ```

2. **Clean Up Stale State**
   ```bash
   # Close existing release PRs
   gh pr close 24 25  # If they exist
   
   # Optionally delete old release branches
   git push origin --delete release-please--branches--main--components--models
   git push origin --delete release-please--branches--main--components--sdk
   ```

3. **Commit Permission Fix**
   - Update CI workflow to handle coverage badge without write permission issues
   - Or skip coverage badge on PRs, only update on main

### Testing Sequence

Once permissions are fixed:

1. **Test Release-Please**
   - Make a small change with conventional commit
   - Verify release PR is created
   - Check PR content and version bumps

2. **Test Auto-Merge**
   - Verify release PR gets auto-merged
   - Check that GitHub release is created

3. **Test Models Publish**
   - Verify publish-models workflow runs
   - Check package appears on npm (requires NPM_SECRET)
   - Verify GitHub Package is created

4. **Test SDK Dependency Update**
   - Verify update-sdk-models-dependency creates PR
   - Check PR updates SDK dependency correctly

5. **Test SDK Release**
   - Merge SDK dependency update PR
   - Verify release-please creates SDK release PR
   - Test SDK publish workflow

## Lessons Learned

1. **Workspace Dependencies Are Crucial**
   - Can't depend on unpublished packages from npm
   - `workspace:*` is the correct approach for monorepos
   - Build scripts must convert workspace to versions for publishing

2. **Permissions Are Critical**
   - Default GITHUB_TOKEN has limited permissions
   - Repository settings control what Actions can do
   - Must explicitly enable PR creation and release creation

3. **Clean State Matters**
   - Pre-existing PRs and branches can conflict
   - Fresh start often better than trying to reconcile state
   - Old tags don't hurt, just ignore them

4. **Testing In Steps**
   - Can't test full flow without fixing foundations first
   - Dependencies matter: permissions → PRs → releases → publishes
   - Each component can be tested independently

---

## Outstanding Questions

1. ❓ Does the repository have NPM_SECRET configured?
   - Required for publishing to npm
   - Can test with workflow_dispatch once permissions fixed

2. ❓ Should we delete old tags or keep them?
   - Recommend keeping for history
   - Won't interfere with new workflows

3. ❓ Coverage badge commit on main - how to handle?
   - Current approach tries to commit on push to main
   - Might conflict with branch protection rules
   - Alternative: Use a bot account or skip on protected branches

## Ready for Production?

**Not yet.** Blockers:

1. ❌ Fix release-please permissions
2. ❌ Clean up stale release PRs
3. ❌ Test full release cycle
4. ❌ Verify npm publishing works (requires NPM_SECRET)
5. ⚠️ Decide on coverage badge approach

**Once These Are Resolved:**
- ✅ Workflow architecture is sound
- ✅ Code is ready
- ✅ Documentation is complete
- ✅ No syntax errors in any workflow

**Estimated Time to Production:** 
- With repository access: 30-60 minutes (fix permissions, test, iterate)
- Without repository access: Provide fixes to repository owner, wait for testing

---

## Commit for Permission Fix

```bash
# After fixing repository permissions, commit this:
git add .github/workflows/release-please.yaml
git commit -m "fix: add id-token permission to release-please

Adds id-token: write permission which may be required
for creating GitHub releases with the release-please action."
git push origin main
```

Then test again with a small change to trigger the pipeline.
