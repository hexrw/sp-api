# Report Types, Formats and Fields

As of the time of writing (Aug 2025), the official documentation includes a list of fields for each report type, but it does not provide any explanation of what those fields mean beyond their names. The only exception to this is that sometimes some fields are described in the report type's description.

However, most of these reports have a sibling available in the Seller Central. These reports are often more user-friendly and provide explanations for the fields in the Help section of Seller Central, for example: [Seller Central Help - FBA Manage Inventory](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G200740930).

You will probably have to log in to Seller Central with a valid seller account to access the Help section.
