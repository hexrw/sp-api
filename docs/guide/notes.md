# Notes on your Amazon Selling Partner Appstore Listing

If you requested secure roles, such as the Tax Role, **a review process might be triggered at any time** without warning. This can lead to your app being suppressed, stripped of permissions (roles) or even completely removed from the Appstore. If this happens, you will not be able to authorize any new sellers until you resolve the issue.
