# Trouble authorizing new sellers

## Apps in "draft" status

- Limited to 25 authorizations total.
- If you reach this limit, you must publish your app to continue authorizing new sellers.
- To publish, you must complete the app submission process, including providing a privacy policy and terms of service.

## Published apps

- Can authorize an unlimited number of sellers.

If your application listing get's suppressed, **you won't be able to authorize sellers above the 25 limit**. This can happen at any time, even if your app was previously published and approved without issue. Amazon often suppresses apps without warning, especially if they suspect your app is not compliant with their policies or the **provided website does not match the features listed** in your Amazon Selling Partner Appstore listing.
